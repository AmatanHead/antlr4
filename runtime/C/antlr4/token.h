/**
 * Determines how `line` and `column` are calculated.
 *
 * In normal mode, they are 1-based numbers that indicate number of line and number of codepoint in that line.
 * Normal mode is used for displaying error messages in console.
 *
 * In LSP mode, they are 0-based numbers that indicate index of line and index of the first byte of a codepoint
 * in a UTF-16 representation of the line. This mode is primarily used for LSP servers.
 *
 * For example, the letter `b` in the file `aêêÄêêÄb` has coordinates:
 *
 * - `1:4` in normal mode because it's located on the first line and it's the fourth codepoint in its line.
 * - `0:5` in LSP mode because it's line index is zero and in UTF-16 representation its codepoint start index is five.
 *   That is, `a` takes one byte and `êêÄ`s takes four more bytes.
